# Scribbler-Python

This repository contains three projects, written in python 2.7. The projects were made for an introductory CS class at Georgia Tech. Runnning these projects requires python 2.7 and installation of the myro libraries (http://myro.roboteducation.org/download/). The projects are:

1. Robot Web Writer - This script connects to the scribbler robot and makes it take pictures. These pictures are then automatically uploaded to a pre-specified website.
2. Special FX - This program has several functions that create different effects on images taken by the scribbler robot, or on any image in general.
3. Robot Movie - This program contains scripts written to run two robots to film a movie on each other. More description is in the project repo.
