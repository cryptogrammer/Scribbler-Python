This program contains scripts written to run two robots to film a movie on each other.

Project Write-Up

Scenario:

This homework was filmed with robots, Robot 1 and Robot 2. The entire film has been shot from Robot 2ís perspective.

Robot 2 is rolling along in a CS lab one day when it sees Robot 1 asleep and decides to stalk it. Robot 2 retreats to behind a box to watch Robot 1 and to wait
for it to wake from its sleep. Robot 1 wakes up and looks around, then exits the computer lab, while Robot 2 watches from behind the box.

Robot 1 now moves toward the stairs while Robot 2 watches from a distance. Robot 1 turns round a corner and moves out of Robot 2ís sight.
Robot 2 then decides to roll forward and follow closely behind Robot 1. Robot 1 realizes itís being followed but by now has been cornered at the top of a flight of stairs.
It turns around desperately but sees no escape. Robot 2 approaches at high speed and pushes Robot 1 down the stairs.
The final shot is of Robot 1 lying at the foot of the stairs with its guts spilt on the floor. 


Special Effects used:

1. Fadeout

2. Seeing Red

3. Overlay


Deviations from Code Layout:

Acting and Filming code have been combined into one python file. The two codes canít be separated into different files because the picture
taking and the movements are intertwined in the same code as they occur simultaneously.
